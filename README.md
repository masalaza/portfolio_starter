Each FLW class will be expected to create and maintain a Class Portfolio
that includes information about the company, class, Code Nation, and links
to all students' portfolios. The PM or volunteers of the class will have
to fill in the basic template before class begins, and most Guided Practices
will involve group worktime to improve the Class Portfolio one skill at a time.
